# The Humor Lab Project

This is an offshoot from the documentary film Very Semi Serious. An offbeat documentary about humor, art and the genius of the New Yorker cartoon.

The Humor Lab aims to be an interactive deconstruction of the beloved New Yorker cartoons that will encourage viewers to examine the science, psychology and philosophy of what makes us laugh.
